# Portfolio Builder

The portfolio builder is a web application under development that allows the creation of a portfolio according to the profile information provided through forms.

Built under the microservices architecture, the frontend developed through the Vuejs framework uses an API made with Django and a rest framework that uses Postgresql as a database engine.
